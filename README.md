# Moppy2-UNOR3-HDD
Device implementation for Moppy2 for microcontrollers that support the Arduino **framework**.  This one was set up exactly for **Arduino Uno R3** (via the Arduino IDE) with two L298N connected, each with two HDDs connected (four HDDs in total). HDDs in this case should behave like drums.
